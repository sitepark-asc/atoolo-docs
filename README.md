The generated documentation is available at the following URL.

https://sitepark.github.io/atoolo-docs/

The documentation is generated with the static site generator [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

# Install MkDocs

```sh
pip install mkdocs
```

See [here](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/) if `pip` is not available.

Install [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

```sh
pip install mkdocs-material
 ```

# Building the site


```sh
mkdocs build
 ```

This will create a new directory named `public`` where the generated documentation will be stored.

# Write documentation

MkDocs comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview your documentation as you work on it.

```sh
mkdocs serve
 ```
