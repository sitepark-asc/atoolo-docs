# Develop with Atoolo

## Components

Atoolo components are individual, preferably independent libraries that cover a defined functional area.

[Components](components/index.md)

## Bundles

Atoolo Bundles are [Symfony Bundles](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles.html){:target="\_blank"} that extend Symfony projects with certain Atoolo functionalities.

[Bundels](bundles/index.md)

## GraphQL API

Atoolo makes it easy to create and deploy GraphQL interfaces, allowing web applications to access structured data and perform complex search queries and interact with the suite's components for dynamic data handling.
