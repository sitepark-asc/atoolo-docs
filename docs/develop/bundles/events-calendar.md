## RCE-Event integration

[RCE-Event](https://www.rce.de/produkte/rce-event/uebersicht/){:target="\_blank"} is establishing itself as the standard in German-speaking countries for the recording, administration, distribution and publication of events.

This bundle provides an indexer that transfers the events from RCE-Event to the search index. This allows the events to be found as an external page via the search.
